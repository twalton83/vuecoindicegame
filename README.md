# vuecoindicegame

I have a few repositories for a classic coin/dice betting game. The game is simple enough, but the concepts are valuable in learning how to manage state with a given technology or framework, how to manage dynamic updates to content, lifecycle methods, and more. I treat the Coin Dice Game as the "Hello World" of getting applications under a certain framework off the ground.
