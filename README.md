# vuecoindicegame

I have a few repositories for a classic coin/dice betting game. The game is simple enough, but the concepts are valuable in learning how to manage state with a given technology or framework, how to manage dynamic updates to content, lifecycle methods, and more. I treat the Coin Dice Game as the "Hello World" of getting applications under a certain framework off the ground. 

This project was intended to get me going with Single File Components, which is a convention I'm familiar with in React (especially when you consider that CSS-in-JS allows us to keep styles in one file with the component, just like Vue does!)
